# Code 301 Project

## Code 301 Intermediate Software Development by LTUC/ASAC.
In this course we learned how to create and launch web apps in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, with the help of third-party application programming interfaces (API) and libraries.

And to pass this course we have a project at the end, so that we create the **Buddy-nav** web application.

## Buddy-nav "The story behind" 

<br>

Buddy-nav is a web application that helps you and guide you with your journeys plans. So, what is the Buddy-nav? Let us read this story from one of our stakeholders.

Mr. Aront said "Always when I want to have a plan to travel outside my country, I searched in more than website to get details about the city or country that i want to visit"

And he added " I wish if there is a way to have those information in one place, and regarding the COVID-19, I really want to know about the its details in this country"

So, we asked him about what is the information that you are willing to have, the answer " You know the needed information; like the weather statues, hotels, transportation and the COVID-19 details."
